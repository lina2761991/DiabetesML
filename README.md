# DiabetesML
This is my first machine learning project that is meant to predict whether or not a person is going to have diabetes.You would find below the django web app, the jupyer notebook and the presentation associated. <br/>
In order to run it you have to implement the following commands: <br/>
pip3 install django <br/>
pip3 install virtualenv <br/>
pip3 install pandas <br/>
pip3 install matplotlib <br/>
pip3 install seaborn <br/>
pip3 install virtualenv <br/>

I used vscode as an IDE and anaconda to run the jupyer notebook <br/>
